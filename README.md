# FakeSticker

Works 100% for some users<br>
Breaks when disabling and re-enabling plugin (requires a restart for fix)<br>
Sometimes animating doesn't work<br>
Annything else? Idk<br>
I only "tried" fixing plugins main functionality, send a sticker, manifest or anything has been touched<br>
BASICALLY AN OVERWRITE
